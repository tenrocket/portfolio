      %h1#modal_header ABOUT ME
      %p#modal_text I believe in bravery.  Sure I love making things, but I became a developer because I used to say it was impossible.  I sold myself excuses like, "I'm too right-brained to be an engineer", and "That's just not how my mind works".  I'm no fan of self-imposed limitations, and my work is a reflection of my lifelong quest to build a more empowered world.  As you look through my portfolio, I hope it inspires you to strive for excellence in your own life.  Hopefully you will notice an eye for design as well.
